# DP-Checklist
Disaster Preparedness Checklist for persons to check their readiness for a disaster and for the relevant agencies to check on and provide help for those in need.

**Inspiration**
When we were challenged with coming up with, and executing a project that involves data analytics and is relevant right now, we thought of this as something that can be helpful during the hurricane season and by extension for general disaster preparedness for Jamaicans. 

**What it does**
Hurricane Season is 6 months long and it marked every year, and even though some persons prepare for it, it is not predictable. We are focused mainly on those who are not prepared (according to the checklist) and how the political (Members of Parliament and Councillors ) and local bodies (Neighbourhood Watch and Non-Government Organizations) can proactively use our system to identify the needs of these persons and mobilize help for them.

One can click to access our app or the web platform and then input information based on the checklist of items that will be ticked off and in some cases entered.

When there is an hurricane warning or watch, the relevant authorities/bodies can get reports from the app database that informs of who needs help and the type of help they need. 

**How we built it**
 Researched online for datasets to use 
 Extracted Database into Excel for analysis
 Cleaned dataset using Excel Formulas and Functions
 Analyzed using Power BI
 Connected to mysql atabase using php


**Challenges we ran into**

It got a bit overwhelming working on this project, studying for the courses, attending the classes and still maintaining a full work/school schedule and balancing family time.
It was a bit difficult to find datasets to analyze for individual preparedness 
The datasets about the political representatives was not organized well and there was a lot of formatting and organization to be able to have clean data.
Other datasets that we planned to incorporate were not added as it was time consuming to format

**Accomplishments that we are proud of**

We were able to apply the skills we learnt in preparing data for analysis and providing an analysis. 

**What we learned**
Data cleaning can be time consuming
The relevant data is not necessarily easily obtained 
We have to do what is necessary to achieve results
The solution in our heads is not always workable


**What's next for DP Checklist: **
Allow for more detailed information to be gathered (optional)
Allow constituents to update their information periodically to ensure that contact and preparedness information is current.
Extend functionality to incorporate contact information and maps for nearest supermarkets or stores, and shelters as well as closing times for stores and whether the shelters are full or have space.
Allow information to be entered by text messaging for those without internet service or smart devices.
Allow for speech to text and text to speech input and instructions for the sight or hearing impaired constituents.
