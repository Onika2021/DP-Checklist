# DP-Checklist
Disaster Preparedness Checklist for persons to prepare and for the relevant authority to check on who needs help
Inspiration
When we were challenged with coming up with, and executing a project that involves data analytics and is relevant right now, we thought of something that can be helpful during the hurricane season and by extension for general disaster preparedness for Jamaicans. 
What it does
Hurricane Season is 6 months long and it marked every year, and even though some persons prepare for it, it is not predictable. We are focused mainly on those who are not prepared (according to the checklist) and how the political (Members of Parliament and Councillors ) and local bodies (Neighbourhood Watch and Non-Government Organizations) can proactively use our system to identify the needs of these persons and mobilize help for them.
One can click to access our app or the web platform and then input information based on the checklist of items that will be ticked off and in some cases entered.
When there is an hurricane warning or watch, the relevant authorities/bodies can get reports from the app database that informs of who needs help and the type of help they need. 

**How we built it**

**Challenges we ran into**

It got a bit overwhelming working on this project, studying for the courses, attending the classes and still maintaining a full work/school schedule and balancing family time. 
It was a bit difficult to find datasets to analyze for individual preparedness and the datasets about the political representatives was not organized well and there was a lot of formatting necessary.

**Accomplishments that we are proud of**

I was able to apply the skills I learnt in preparing data for analysis. 

**What I learned**

**What's next for DP Checklist: **
**Allow for more detailed information to be gathered (optional)
Allow constituents to update their information periodically to ensure that contact and preparedness information is current.
Extend functionality to incorporate contact information and maps for nearest supermarkets or stores, and shelters as well as closing times for stores and whether the shelters are full or have space.
Allow information to be entered by text messaging for those without internet service or smart devices.
Allow for speech to text and text to speech input and instructions for the sight or hearing impaired constituents.
